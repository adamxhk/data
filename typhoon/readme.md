This project focuses on typhoon data. I analysed the data to explore the distribution of typhoon grades, from a tropical depression to a severe tropical storm. 
This also explores the distribution of typhoon grades, frequency of typhoons, and the spatial and temporal patterns of typhoons.
The insights from my analysis can be used in disaster manage and preparedness for researchers, governments and other stakeholders to mitigate the effects of typhoons.
